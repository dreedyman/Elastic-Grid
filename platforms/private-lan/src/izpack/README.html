<h1>Elastic Grid @VERSION@</h1>
<p>
    Cloud Computing providers allow a fantastic way to deploy scalable machine images easily and on demand. However,
    there is a finer grain of scalability that must be provided, allowing individual application assets to easily scale
    to meet the demands of a running system. The Elastic Grid approach provides dynamic allocation, management and
    scalability of applications through the cloud.
</p>
<p>
    Elastic Grid provides a straight forward architecture allowing developers and deployers to focus on their
    application, instead of spending time and energy on cloud specific technology and bundling operations.
